Task->1  Text-based-chat-application

The server creates a socket, binds it to a specific address and port, and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, a new thread is created to handle that client's messages separately. The client connects to the server and starts a thread for sending and receiving messages. Both server and client use the socket module to send and receive messages. The communication is text-based, and messages are encoded/decoded using UTF-8. The server prompts the user for a response and sends it to the client, while the client sends a message and waits for a response.
