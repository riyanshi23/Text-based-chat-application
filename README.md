Text-based-chat-application

The server creates a socket, binds it to a specific address and port, and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, a new thread is created to handle that client's messages separately. The client connects to the server and starts a thread for sending and receiving messages. Both server and client use the socket module to send and receive messages. The communication is text-based, and messages are encoded/decoded using UTF-8. The server prompts the user for a response and sends it to the client, while the client sends a message and waits for a response.

Random Password Generator

The generate_password function takes parameters for the desired length and character set preferences and generates a password accordingly. The input function is used to get user input for a password length and character set preferences. The random.choices function is used to randomly select characters from the combined character set to form the password. The script ensures that at least one character set is selected to avoid an empty password. Finally, the input is then used to generate a random password using the generate_password function.

BMI Calculator

The main() function gets user input for weight and height, calls the BMI calculation and classification functions, and then displays the results. We can enter weight and height when prompted, and the program will calculate our BMI and classify it into categories such as underweight, normalweight, overweight and overease.
